# TODO List:

- Need to add IR signal categories (e.g. volume type, channel type, etc) and type to tie into Alexa service
- Create IRSignal dialog: Save button doesn't activate until you click in Name field after entering content.
- User information is not cleared from cache after logging out. Need to refresh browser to clear user.
  - Entity cache is not cleared when user logs out
- Save button on RemoteDashComponent should only be enabled when changes are made
