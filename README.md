# AutomDash

Angular app which allows you to design dashboards to simulate the remote controls (those things in your home used to control your audio/video equipment) in your home. When running on a small computer such as a Raspberry Pi with the appropriate hardware attached you can capture and send IR signals. 


## Credits

   A big Thanks to [Angular University](https://angular-university.io/) for the excellent Angular courses. A lot of Angular Material and NGRX entity/data content comes from the [Angular University GitHub repositories](https://github.com/angular-university) associated with the courses.

   A big Thanks to Chris Kitson's [article](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/drag-and-drop-dashboard-builder-with-angular-and-gridster-a07592e54ce2) on medium.com which detailed how to create a drag and drop dashboard using Gridster.

   This app would not be possible with out LearnIR devices which is the hardware that allows AutomDash to capture and send IR signals. A LearnIR device is an advanced IR learning module packaged as a USB dongle. You can get more information [here](https://www.analysir.com/blog/product/learnir-advanced-infrared-learner-module/)
